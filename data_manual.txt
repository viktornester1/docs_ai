15Coffee output
 Press the coffee key:
 Espresso:  
medium cup (40 ml)
 Lungo:   
large cup (110 ml)
The coffee machine heats up.
The coffee ball is washed with 
hot water for 10 seconds and 
pierced.
The brewing process starts.
After the coffee has been 
prepared, the operating lever 
automatically moves upwards 
and the coffee ball falls into the 
collection container.
 Do not open the control lever 
manually during use!
 Do not remove the collection 
container until the brewing 
chamber has been opened.Brewing process and preinfusion function
The preinfusion function gives 
your coffee more aroma.
For quantities up to 80 ml, a 
small amount of coffee is dis
pensed first. 
The preinfusion function starts 
and the output stops for 3 sec
onds.
The output then continues.
Output stops automatically 
or press the key again to stop 
earlier.
The preinfusion function depends on the output quantity and is 
not associated with the individual keys.
When the keys (page 16) are programmed, the preinfusion 
function remains unchanged for output quantities up to 80 ml. 
For output quantities over 80 ml, the preinfusion function is not 
carried out.  
Coffee balls that have 
not been pierced or 
that are dry can be used 
again.Balls with cracks may 
be used.
DO NOT use broken and

is full.
 Lift the coffee ball and resid
ual water collection contain
er slightly and pull it forwards.
 Empty the collection con
tainer.
 Replace the collection con
tainer.Programming the coffee quantity
The output quantities can be adjusted for each coffee key.
The default settings are:
 Espresso: 40 ml 
 Lungo: 110 ml
The programmable output quantity is 25 – 200 ml.
 Place the cup under the 
spout.
 Check the level of the 
water tank. Fill with water, if 
required.
 Add coffee balls and gently 
close the operating lever.
 Hold down the key to be pro
grammed (e.g. Espresso ) 
for at least 3 seconds, until it 
flashes rapidly three times.

If the water tank empties during programming: 
 Repeat the programming with a full water tank.
 Remove the 
drip tray from the 
machine for at least 
8 seconds so that the 
“CONTAINER” indicator

mode.
The key illumination goes out.
 Press any key or close the 
operating lever to end ener
gy-saving operation.Descaling
When preparing coffee, deposits of water as well as coffee oils 
and fats are left behind in the piping of the coffee machine. 
These residues have a negative effect on the coffee taste. Reg
ular descaling of the machine can remove these residues. 
Coffee machines which are calcified invalidates the warranty.
After 40 l of drinks, the cleaning key  flashes red during dis
pensing.
 Descale the machine thoroughly.  
The descaling process is divided into 3 stages:
Getting ready
Descale (espresso key  lights up, cleaning key  flashes), 
Rinse (lungo key  lights up, cleaning key  flashes).
Attention!  Only use descalers for coffee machines. 
Do not use vinegar or degreasing agents, they will damage the 
coffee maker.

25Troubleshooting
If this troubleshooting guide does not help you solve your prob
lem, please contact your nearest service centre.
The machine may be repaired only by an authorised service 
centre.
No liability will be accepted for any damage due to unprofes
sional repairs and use of non-original spare parts, which may 
endanger the user and will render the guarantee null and void. 
Caution! Immediately disconnect the power supply to a ma
chine that is faulty or defective, or if you suspect damage after 
it has been dropped. Troubleshooting Remedial action
After starting the dispensing 
process, coffee is not dis
pensed for a given period of 
timeThe machine first heats up, 
washes the hot coffee ball with 
hot water before dispensing 
coffee. This can take up to 40 
seconds.

30Troubleshooting Remedial action
The control lever does not 
move up automatically after 
the brewing process Pull the control lever up by 
hand.
Attention!  Do not move the 
control lever upwards during 
brewing, rinsing or descaling.
Incorrect coffee ball in the 
brewing chamber Push the coffee ball down 
with your finger.
 Remove the coffee ball.
If the coffee ball has not be
come wet, it can still be used.
The coffee ball dispenser is 
difficult to turn Clean the coffee ball dis-
penser with rinsing water and 
dry before first use.
The coffee machine makes 
a humming noise during the 
brewing processThis noise is caused by solenoid 
valves in the machine. This is 
due to technical reasons and is 
not a cause for concern.Troubleshooting Remedial action
The coffee machine drips at 
the beginning of the brewing 
processBefore starting the brewing pro
cess, the coffee ball is wetted 
with water. Depending on the 
operating status, the coffee 
machine drips before dispens-
ing the coffee. This is system-re
lated and has no negative 
effect on the coffee quality.
The rinsing water is milky when 
it comes out of the coffee 
machineThe Crema valve in the coffee 
machine produces small air 
bubbles during the brewing 
process. If the rinsing water 
runs through the Crema valve 
during the rinsing process, small 
bubbles are also produced in 
the rinsing water. These cause 
the outflowing rinsing water to 
look milky. 
The water becomes completely 
clear again after a short time, 
as soon as all the bubbles have 
escaped.
